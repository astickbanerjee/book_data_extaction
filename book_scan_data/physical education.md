1.3.1 National Integration
Traditionally Indians are religious in nature Weneednot disown our own religion or language. It
only warns us against hatred for other religions. Secularism does not mean negation of religions,
it means tolerance towards all
regions. This
a caution that there should be no hatred for
others; secularism does not indicate anything irreligious or against any religion. This indicates
tolerance towards all religions.

ago the Emperor Ashoka preached the doctrine of non-violence.
fter the
tremendous bloodshed of the
war he said
Instead of conquering an empire through
war, it is ideal to conquer the hearts of people".
According to the doctrine of Ashoka, it will not be
possible for us to respect our religion unless we respect
the religion of others.
2.
Jainism still stands as the symbol of non-
violence
3
The moral principle of Christian religion is to
love thy neighbours.
4
According to Islamic religion, if one really loves
thy creator
then one should love human beings.

According to Sikh Gurus and Granthasahib, every human is His child and He is for
everyone and He is omnipresent.

We should try to eradicate hatred, superstition, orthodoxy from the mind of the people. There

against communalism and superstition, orthodoxy should be conducted inall the schools, colleges,

discussion on the various aspects of Veda, Koran, Tripitaka and other sacred books then it is

Every Indian who loves India should care for the cultural heritage of the Nation at each and
every work.
Allthereligious Gurus from different religions were the symbols of love, sympathy and sacrifice.
Their personal lives were fullofhumbleness and
taught their disciples to be tolerant towards
other religions.
It is a matter of shame and agony that
many riots and conflicts are
taking place in the
name of religion The terrorists pay no need to the doctrine of the Gurus and
do not
hesitate to attack, loot and kill innocent people, even do not spare children. Thus it is hard to
believe that such heinous acts could be done under the banner of any religion Hence it is clear
that this type of incidents are purely intentional or terroristic or low grade political activities.
Riots androwdiness specifically affect the poor people and the school students
ofthe
followers of various religions for example Hinduism, Islamism, Christianity, Sikhism etc. do not
respect themoral values and so, anti-socialactivities are stillin their peak . The anti-socialactivities
are purely personal and
do not have any far reaching target Communalism and religion
should not be considered as synonymous and secularist mentality is aimed at this  Mahatma
Gandhi said,
Indeed, religion should pervade every one of our actions Here religion does not
mean sectarianism. It means a belief in ordered moral government of the universe. It is not less
real because it is unseen. This religion transcends Hinduism,
Islamism, Christianity, etc. It does not supersede them. It
harmonizes them and gives them reality
For the renaissance and development of
a
nation,
national integrity is an important issue  If we can sustain
our national integrity then there willbepeace andharmony
throughout the nation and firm developmental steps can
be taken up. Sports and games and Physical Education
play an important role to sustain such national integrity
1.3.2 The Role of Physical Education to Sustain
National Integration
The various activities of sports and games and Physical Education enlighten the minds of people
towards national integration. The various aspects are described below:

instructions on life-style, development of good habits or can warn them against harmful
effects of addictions to drugs, etc.
Co-related health instructions: While imparting lessons on other subjects, the teachers
may give health instructions related to those lessons. Such instructions may betermedas
co-related health instructions  For example, while imparting lessons on nutrition in a class
of environment studies, the teacher may discuss about the effects of nutrition on health.
He/ She may give such instructions on nutrition whiling imparting lessons on writing
paragraphs on nutrition

Instructions through camps: Instructions onhealth may be givenby organizing different
health awareness camps in school The same may be done through NCCcamp, Bratachari
camp, `Sab Peyechhir Asar
Scouts and Guides camps, Sports camp, etc.
2.2.5 Health Supervision
Health supervision' means daily, weekly, fortnightly and monthly health check-ups ofthe students
and staff or members ofa schoolor an institute andkeeping records thereof The main objectives
ofhealth supervision are
t0
develop a beautiful and healthy environment in school and (ii)
to make the teaching-learning
of the schoolhealthy for the students.
Health supervision of a school may be done in five ways:
To create a healthy physical atmosphere in school
To supervise personal hygiene of the students
Administrative supervision
Daily supervision by the teachers
Supervisionby doctorslphysicians
(a) To create a
healthy physical atmosphere in school:
The schoolenvironment should bemade clean,
attractive, healthy and joyful. The natural
surroundings of the schoolneed to bebeautiful.
It should be free from damp, dust, garbage or
noise.
The classrooms, laboratory, library, stairs,
corridors, playground and toilets must be clean,
beautifuland spacious.
111)
The school rooms should be airy and well-lighted.
(1V)
The
seating arrangements should be comfortable and scientific, so that the back
bone, neck andeye-sight remain free from stress.
The school should have constant source of clean and pure
drinking water: Regular
water testing should be done.
The school should provide the students with sufficient number of clean and hygienic
toilets and bathrooms.
v1)
Dustbins or waste-bins should bekept at particular places in the school campus.
(viii)
Dust-free chalks should beused.

Badhabits like spitting and urinating anywhere and everywhere should be checked.
To make them aware about
health andhygienic systems of the school.
V)
To assist students in developing proper limb formation (body movements/ structures 
vi)
To make students participate in games and exercises.
Administrative supervision:
1)
Mid-Day-Meal programme, milk project and other nutritional programmes should be
arranged properly
11 
Daily routine should be followed, any discrepancies thereof should be overcome.
11)
Medical investigation and their follow-up programme should be maintained carefully
and regularly
Daily supervision by the
teachers:
The areas to be surveyed by
the teachers are as follow:
1)
Behaviour ofthe students
11)
Dresses anduniforms
iii)   Reading

Suprervision by doctors physicians:
doctor cannot check or
surpervise a student daily. So the teachers will detect any serious
health problem and sendhim her to the doctor: Weekly or monthly health check-up programmes
should be taken up
The areas to be covered by a doctor are
1
Whetherthe school
building, drinking water, sanitation facilities, etc. are hygienic or not
11)
Whether the time table, daily routine and teaching-learning programmes are healthy or
not.

2.2.6 Health Service
Health service is such a service project that takes up and materializes programmes of the
students' health check-up, health regain, health protection and development and deals with
the scope for scientific health application and its best
usage. The main objective of health service is to develop
the health of the students by the concertedefforts of the
teachers, guardians and health specialists.
The different programmes of health services are
1) Organizing health check-up camps at
intervals
2)
To arrange first-aid treatment
3)
up different programmes to prevent
infectious diseases
4) To spread health education
5) Tomake students habituated to disciplinedlife
To arrange for Mid-Day-Meal
Weekly or monthly health check-up for the students
1.

2.
To separate students infected with infectious diseases
3.
To arrange for their treatment by the school authority, if possible
4.
To give proper guidance and advice to the concerned guardians
Follow-up programmes:
The health check-up of the students is to be done
a
competent doctor and the physical
education teacher as wellas other teachers connected with schoolhealth programme may enquire
about the health of the students.
Taking up necessary steps following the advice of the doctors as per the results of medical tests
are called follow-up programmes. The necessary steps for this are
1.
To separate students having infectious diseases and to give advice to their guardians
2
To arrange for preventives, vitamins, iodine, etc. for the infected students
3
To arrange for nutritious food for the students

To   prevent infectious
diseases by timely
vaccination:
The school is not beyond the boundary of the society
So communicable diseases often spread among the
school children.
It has to be stopped by timely
vaccination ofthe students.
First-aid treatment and emergency cares:
To arrange for the first-aid treatment and emergency
treatment at school is an inseparable part of school
health programme.
Facilities of a health centre at school: The students should not only be provided with regular
health check-up facilities but also with the facilities ofa health centre at school
Special care for CWSNS: Special assistance, treatment and recreation facilities should be
provided to the children with special needs.
2.2.7 Healthy School Atmosphere
The atmospherelenvironment that helps the children develop their physical, mental, emotional
and cognitive qualities and in which
can lead a healthy, pure and actively creative life is
called a healthy atmosphere or environment Health protection programme has two significant
aspects
1)Direct aspect: detection of students' diseases and the remedy thereof, and2) Indirect
aspect: To create and preserve a healthy atmosphere. Healthy atmosphere helps in health
protection, health improvement, physical, mental and emotional development of the children In
a
word, ithelps in theallround development of the children Only proper treatment and balanced
diet cannot ensure proper development of the children. For that, a healthy environment is a
necessity; it ensures health development and makes up deficiencies.
Constituents tools of a healthy atmosphere:
(1)
Pure air

Healthy atmosphere of the school: Health protection programme in school has its direct
aspects in arranging health check-up camps, treatment facilities, balanced diet and in helping
students overcome their problems. The indirect aspects include creation ofhealthy atmosphere
and thereby helping students in the
improvement of their health and in
eradicating the causes of diseases
Therefore, to create ahealthy atmosphere
বিদযলিম
in schoolis a significant part of the indirect
বরানা{
aspect ofhealth protection programme  It
depends on the following matters
1) Location of the institution
An
educational institution should be
located in a
place by the
roadaway from the din and bustle
of the crowd. It should be convenient for the students and the teachers to attend school
in time and to do their activities with whole-hearted attention. The teaching-learning
activities can be carried out best ina calmand
atmosphere.
2)  The area and the space of the school
The area and the space should be proportionate
to the number of the students, teachers and other staff of the school, so that each and
every one may feel comfortable enough. It should be
and welllighted.
3)  The buildings and the classrooms : The school building should be South-facing, so that
sun light may enter the classrooms directly The doors and windows should be big
enough and the rooms must be well-ventilated. The classrooms must have modern and
scientific teaching aids and appliances. There should be book corner, activity corner
and tools for creative development in each and every room
4) Availability ofemergency arrangements
There are many students, valuable documents
and goods in every school. To save them from any disaster
emergency situation,
especially firemishaps theremust be fire fightingequipments andarrangements in schools.
5) Cleanliness : Classrooms, furniture, playground, corridors, schoolyards, etc. should be
cleaned regularly This maintains thehealthy atmosphere in school andkeeps every one
cheerful and inspires everyone to be active.
Exchange of good wishes

2
Restroom : Itis difficult to
up attention in teaching-learning activities continuously
for 5 to 6 hours. So to overcome monotony there should be a rest room with some
recreational arrangements for indoor games As a result, the students may be able to
achieve educational goals with whole-hearted attention

The playground of a school is a part of the healthy atmosphere of the
school. It helps develop the physical as well as mental health of the students. Swami
Vivekananda once said, Itis better to play football than to read the Gita.
Itmeans,
physical activity is a must to keep the body and the mind fit and healthy Through games
and sports one cam develop more able and active physique. So for the implementation

Water Supply
Safe drinking water facilities must be there in a school Unavailability of
safe and pure drinking water leads to illhealth of the students and spread of infections
by water borne diseases. There should be proper drainage system too. Water-logging
on the campus may help germs to spread and that is against the norms of the sound
health ofthe students.
14
Toilets
Number of toilets in a school should be in proportion to the number of students.
There must be separate toilets for the boys and the girls and male teachers and the lady
teachers Germicides like phenol, napthalin, carbolic acid, etc. should be used regularly
to clean the toilets. There must be
running or potted water for use in the toilets.
15.
Cure Centre Medical Clinic
There should bea Cure centre ineach school. The students
should learn how to diagnose a disease and treat it or to send the patient to suitable
place through the cure centre in order to realize the objectives ofhealth education. It
may be done through first-aid-treatment in school.

Fame and social dignity:
Healthy Atmosphere of the Playground
An important constituent of physical activities  programmes is the playground No activities of
physicaleducation is possible in the absence ofa playground An ideal playground is necessary
for different types of sports and physical activities. The playground is called the laboratory ofthe
physical programmes. So there must be an ideal playground in each school as well as in each
village or town. The environmentlatmosphere of an ideal playground depends on the following
factors:
1
The playground should be adjacent to the school or in the middle of a village.
2
The length and breadth of an ideal playground should be at least 130m. and 90m.
respectively
3
It should have boundary walls, so that no cattle can enter into it.

2.3.1. Body Mass Index
Body Mass index (BMI) is a specific system of measurement ofbody fat on the basics ofheight
and weight of an individual  Formerly, it was used to calculate whether an adult man or woman
is over-weight or under weight and accumulation of fat is more or less than requirement But
now it1s
on the children also.
Definition: Body Mass Index is such a system that gives an idea about the amount of fat
present in the body of an individual in comparison to the individual 's height and weight
The Body Mass Idex (BMI), or Quetelet Index, is a heuristic proxy for human body fat
based on an individual's weight and height BMI does not actually measure the percentage of
body fat It was devised between 1830 and 1850 by the Belgian polymath Adolphe
Quetelet during the course of developing
'social physics'
mass index is defined as the
individual's body mass dividedby the square ofhis orherheight: The formula universally usedin
medicine produce a unit of measure ofkg/m'. BMI can also be determined using a BMI
chart, which displays BMIas a function of weight (horizontal axis) and height (vertical axis)
using contour lines for different values of BMI or colours for different BMI categories.
While the formula previously called the Quetelet Index for BMI dates back to the 19th century,
thenewterm
Body Mass Index'
for the ratio and its popularity dates back to a paper published
in the July edition of 1972 in the Journol of Chronic Diseuses by Ancel
which found the
BMI to be the best proxy for body fat percentage among ratios of weight and height.
The formula for
calculating BMI is weight in kilograms (kg) divided by height in meters (m)

Advantages of BMI
BMIis generally considered the best way to determine if an individual is at a healthy
weight. Calculation of BMLis popular because it is simple, quick, effective and applies
to adult men and women, as wellas children. BMIis a useful tool for quickly assessing
weight classification While it does not directly measure body fat, it is more accurate at
approximating degree of body fatness than weight alone. In addition, you do not have to
be of an exact weight or measurement, to be considered
normal.
There is a range
within
classification to allow for different body types and shapes. For example,
you can be 40 to 50 kg heavier than a same height counterpart and still fall within a
normal weight range.
only simple calculations are required from standard height and weight measurements
Implement appropriate strategies to manage and prevent obesity on a population basis
worldwide.
Develop policy recommendations for a coherent and effective global approach to the
management and prevention of obesity
Simple, quick, effective and applicable to adult men and women, as well as to children
useful tool for quickly assessing weight classification
More accurate at approximating degree of body fatness than weight alone.
Limitations:
BMIhas limitations  Becauseitisnotameasure
ofbody fatness, very muscular individuals
often fall into the overweight category when
are not overly fat BMI may place
individuals who have lost muscle into the healthy weight category Measuring BMI for
very short people or pregnant women is not appropriate. It is believed that excessive
abdominal fat is more health threatening than hip or thigh fat Awoman with a waist
circumference greater than 35 inches and a man with a waist circumference of greater
than 40 inches may be at an increased risk for developing high blood pressure, stroke
andheart disease. Therefore, the National Institute of Health (NIH) has askedphysicians
tomeasure
patients' waistlines.
Because it isnota measurement ofbody fatness, very muscular individuals often fallinto
the overweight category when
arenot overly fat
BMImay place individuals who have lost muscle into the healthy weight category
Muscle is heavier than fat so a very muscular person might be considered 'overweight'
evenif
are very fit.

2.4.1 Obesity
Obesity, over-weight are not signs of soundlgood health. Obesity is the presence of excessive
fat in the body and unusual growth of adipose tissue. Generally, 15% of the body weight of a
male adult is fat while 20% of the body weight of a female adult is fat. If this fat increases by
obesity is caused. This problem exists not only in our country but in other countries of the world
[00.
Causes of obesity or over-weight: There are many reasons for obesity
Family Trend:
people think that obesity is hereditary But actually obesity has nothing to
do with
heredity Itis sometimes found that some families have the tradition of eating too much
high-calorie food like butter, ghee, sugar, etc. In such cases, obesity may be almost hereditary
But the real cause is intake ofhigh-calorie food
Lack of Physical Activity: Lack of physical activities and exercises is one of the
leading
causes
of becoming fat or obese. Fat people are rare in the hilly areas as
work hard in their
t0
life. If the calorie taken through food is not spent regularly, obesity may be caused.
Economic Condition: Economically well-off people take in more food than necessary, which
leads to obesity

Change of Profession: Change of one's profession may lead to obesity For example, if a
wood-cutter leaves his job and becomes a clerk and doesnot
any change inhis diet, heis
likely to become fat very soon.
Effects of Hormones: Due to irregular secretion ofhormones from Thyroid and Pituitary
glands sometimes hinders the metabolic activities As a result of that, obesity may occur and
one's weight may increase. Of course, obesity due to hormonal disorder occurs only in 5%
cases
Food Habit: Food is the main source of our growth, development and energy But overeating
is one of the major reasons for obesity The main ingredients of food are Carbohydrates, Fat,
Protein, Vitamins and Minerals. The proportion of the intake of Carbohydrates, Protein and Fat
should be 4:1:1 as 60-70%
of calorielenergy comes from Carbohydrates, 10-25% comes from
Protein and 20-30% comes from Fat Carbohydrates and Fat are the main source of energy
On the other hand, Carbohydrate is easier to digest than Fat So
we should eat more
Carbohydrates than Fat. If we fail to
up this ratio or if we eat more Fat than necessary,
thereis a
possibility of becoming fat.
Age Effect: There is a possibility of an increase of .51g weight per year after attaining 25 years
Foodhabit as per demand of younger age may be suitable for that age But if we do not
give up that habit when we grow in age, there is a possibility of becoming fat due to excess of
food intake.
Principles of weight losing:
1) In case of males 7% and in case of females 12% of fat may be cut down
2) To reduce 1lb fat one needs to
3500 calorie.
3) To decreasemore than 4lb fat a week is not desirable, as it may be harmful for health
4)
Generation of calorie from intake of foodand exhaustion of calorie through work should
berecorded daily
5)
The exhaustion of calorie through work should be more than the calorie generatedby
foodintake
Ifone wants to eat food worth 2000 calorie less than the exhaustible calorie, one should
consult a physician
Life style needs to be changed and intake of cold drinks, fat, carbohydrates should be
lessened.
Things to do to cut down fat:
1) Children shouldbe fedonlyif
are
hungry Foodhabit should be restricted/ controlled.
2) Vegetables should be eaten in large quantity; fat-rich food, fish, meat, etc. should be
taken as less as
possible.
3) Habit of going asleep anytime should be dropped:

Ifthe calorie generated from the intake of food daily is greater than
the calorie required, the excess calorie deposits in our body We
call it the balance ofpositive energy This leads to increase in body
weight. Suppose a student has an excess of 500 calorie per
compared to his requirement That is, the total excess of calorie ina
week sums up to 3500 calorie. It increases 1lb of fat in his body If
that student does strenuous exercise, the excess calorie will form
fatless muscles  Otherwise it willincrease his body weight.
If the calorie generated from the intake of food daily is less than the calorie
required, we call it balance of negative energy To make up this deficit the fat
tissues of the body dissolves to generate calorie. Suppose, the daily calorie
deficit of a student is 500 calorie. That is, the total deficit of calorie ina week
sums up to 3500 calorie. That means Ilb of fat will dissolve to generate 3500
calorie to make up that energy deficit. So his weight will decrease by 1lb a
week.
2.4.2 Malnutrition
Intake of alltypes of nutrients is essential for proper growth and appropriate nutrition of the
body Lack ofappropriate proportion of nutrient and amount of food intake leads to malnutrition
Lack ofany of the six nutrients i.e  protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and water,
willcausemalnutrition
Definition : The illhealth due to lack ofbalanced diet is called malnutrition.

Insufficient intake of food or lack of food :
a)
Lack of animal protein and hike in market prices.
b) Disproportionate intake of fat
Lack of in food intake of macro and micro elements
(Ca, K, Na, Mb etc) in food.
Inadequate intake of proper amount of protein, fat and
carbohydrate the body-building food.
Environmental condition
a)
Decrease ofagricultural land and cultivation.
৮)
Population explosion
Excessive use of chemical fertilizers.
d)

২)
Poverty, unemployment, andpollution are main factors.
Lack of consciousness about science of nutrition.
g
Lack of management in daily routine.
Diseases due to malnutrition
Various diseases are caused
due to lack ofproper nutrients and balanced diet Generally people suffer from night
blindness,
asthma, beriberi, scurvy, rickets, skin-
disease etc. due to lack of proper nutrition.
Remedial measures : Proper remedial measures should be taken up to eradicate the diseases.

Effect of malnutrition on sports and games
Malnutrition hinders demonstration and
acquisition of skill. Generally, people suffer from various diseases due to malnutrition, which
results in lack of concentration in any work . Due to malnutrition the energy of the body becomes
low and as a result there is a lack of strength and endurance. Physical fitness also depends on
proper nutrition that helps demonstrate the skills in sports and games properly
Due to malnutrition any injury takes a
time to healup Malnutrition and inadequate diet
cause
malfunctioning of the internal organs of the body which make an individual gradually weak
and prone to infection and as a result the
performance becomes poor in sports and games

CHAPTER -III
First-Aid
3.1.1. concept of First aid
The First aid concept was first introducedby German Physician Frederick
Edgemarc. Franco-German War, also called Franco-Prussian War, was
declared on July 19, 1870 and Frederick Edgemarc was
appointed
as
Surgeon General  He thought that before the injured could be transferred
to a doctor, there is one important and hard work to be done. If this
simple but tough job is
FIRST AID
performed in time then
the chances of survival of the patient increase.
This way of primary treatment has spread
throughout the world and many patients who
are on death bed may be cured. Each year
throughout the world, crores of the people are
taking the training of this primary treatment or
first aid, gaining knowledge and passing the
exams. It should bekept in mind that a single person trained in first aid can save a precious life.
The first
that should be done by a first aider to save the patient is to stop the out flow of
blood and arrange for artificial respiration, if necessary Thus First Aid can be defined as an
immediate and temporary scientific care given to a victim of an accident or sudden illness before
the services ofa physician is obtained: The various scientific steps that are taken during firstaid
treatment follow .
3.1.2. First aid rules for the First Aider

3.1.3. Duties of the First Aider
1. The specialist should immediately respond to
a callof
casualty or even if there is only information
about casualty the specialist should rush there with
all sorts ofaids.
2.
The first aid box should always be ready so
that there is no wastage of time to reach the spot
3
There should bekeen attention in and around
the spot to avoid further casualties from burning
houses, machineries,
tanks of vehicles,
kerosene oil stores,
pumps, live electric wires, leakage of poisonous gases etc.
4
Treatment can be done in open air if the environment is congenial or else the patients
should be shifted indoors which are free of crowds.
5
Information to be gathered about the nearby hospitals and health centres.

1v)
Detect the pattern of infection or poison.
Diagnose the disease.
If someone falls from a bicycle or a rickshaw then the person should immediately be rescued
and cleaned off the dust. Ifthe person is bleeding then tincture iodine, nebasulf powder may be
or the extract of
marigold leaves which also act as antiseptic may be applied If the
injuries are fatal, then the patient should be shifted to the nearest hospital in a comfortable
position and this is one of the primary duties that come under first aid If the patient is suffering
from respiratory trouble then arrangements should be made for artificial respiration which is also
a
part of primary treatment  Primary treatment consultant may go to the doctor along with the
patient as he can explain the condition of the patient in detail and side-by-side the consultant
should be capable enough to handle an emergency situation
3.1.4. Concept of using of Bandages
bandage is a primary material of first aid and it is used to holda dressing on wounds, to create
pressure to
bleeding or to provide a support to an injured part. This is also used to support
broken bones and muscle
ofthe body Bandages are made of different types of materials
like gauze, muslin, flannel, elastic webbing etc.
According to the shape, bandages are categorized into two types :
a.
Roller bandage
b
Triangular bandage

Sizes of Roller
Bandages
Roller bandages may be of any length but the width varies between 1, 2-2.50, 3-3.50,4-4.50
inches Generally 1 inch is
011
fingers, 2-2.5 inches on hand and head, 3-3.50 inches on
and 4-4.50 inches over the body
Applying the Roller Bandages
For simplicity of description let us assume that a person is standing straight and the
1s
stretched out in front: The roller bandage has two parts
the head and (ii) the tail or the loose
end.
On the wound medicine is applied and covered thickly with cotton. The wounded place should
bekept still while applying the roller bandage. The roll is then passed round the wound and two
or three initial turns should overlie each other to secure the bandage. The tension and direction
of the bandage should be such that it does not hamper blood flow and
should be comfortable. As the loose end is reached it may be tied, pinned,
or fastened with adhesive tape.
Four methods to apply Roller Bandage
1.
Circular turns: This type of turns in the bandage is applied where
the body parts are mostly cylindrical,
for example fingers, wrists etc.
2.
Reverse turns: This 1s
to those parts of the
body which are
having unequal circumference. The initial
turns ofa
bandage areapplied securely; the subsequent turns

are
applied to the body parts with smallest circumference and then towards the larger
circumference, for example, in bandaging the
or foot, the initial turns are applied
immediately above the ankle. Here the circular turns are not useful.
3.
Figure-of-eight type of turns: This figure-of-eight type of bandage is used around the
elbow joint and the turns are made flexible to allow a certain amount of movement. The
turns overlie each other in a criss-cross fashion that resembles a figure of 8.
4.
Spica: The spica method is used to retain dressing of the shoulder, armpit or chest This
is similar to the figure-of-eight turns however the succeeding turn ascending and covering
two-thirds of the previous turn and forming a figure like the leaves around a corn which
1s calleda
spica"' .
Triangular Bandage
Generally a 38 by 38 inch cloth is cut diagonally to make a triangular bandage. Triangular
bandage consists of three corners and three arms  The
corner is known as apex and thearm
opposite to it is called the base. The corners connected to the base at the either sides is called

3.2.1. First aid treatment for burn-injuries
burn is a type ofinjury to the skin caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation
The more deeply the burn penetrates the more it is fatal If 1/3 of the
upper portion of the body is burnt then there may bea life risk Burns
are of two types
burn and (ii) Wet burn.

If acid falls in the eyes then few drops of water is applied followed by drops of milk,
breastmilk ifavailable is more effective.
B
If burnt by bases then
(i) Mild acid like lemon juice, tamarind or sour curd is applied.
Classification of burns and their treatment procedure
First degree burns (Ariemma): The skin usually turns red, swells and is painful with a
burning sensation. Restricted to superficial skin without blisters and heals within 3-5
and
the burnt skin peels away, however, the burn scar remains.
After the burnt skin
off then
milk cream, coconut oil, egg or burnolis applied:
Second degree burns: Second degree burns are more serious and swelling is intense.
The irritation is extreme and the skin turns deep red The second
degree burns penetrate below the top layer of the skin but not too
deep  If there is no infection or sore then the wound is healedup
from below the skin within a week and no scar is left. The skin
turns normal within 10-15 days  If there is any infection in the
blisters then it takes time to heal up and medicine needs to be
In this situation the first aider should dress the wound
properly and take the injured to the doctor immediately
(1i)
Third degree burns (skin becomes dead): Third degree burns are worse and
penetrate to all the layers of the skin. Tremendous damage can occur that affects the bloodstream,
major organs and bones. The blood and the protein of the skin clots and the skin looks charred
and waxy below which lie the dead organs. Third degree burns heal in two steps: firstly the
wound turns towards granulation tissue which gradually turns to scaled tissues.
In cases of the first three degrees of burns protein plasma oozes from the injuries As a result,
nervous
injury is caused So the oozing of protein plasma should be stopped as soon as pos-
sible Ripe mango pulp and the white substance of the egg minus egg
should be used very
gently over the wounds. The patient should be sent to a doctor or to the hospital very soon,
placing the victim on banana leaves or on something comfortable. Sometimes skin grafting is
done to heal the wounds.
(iv)
Fourth degree burns : Such burns are caused by the effects ofhyper-thermal agent on
tissues, such as open flames, molten metal, etc. This is the most dangerous burn that
affects skin, muscles, bones and other parts of the body The wounds
up very slowly To
cover up the wounds skin grafting is done. So many symptoms start from these burn wounds as

a result of change in the central nervous system (pain shock)  Moreover, as a result of oozing of
plasma and absorption of poisonous decomposed dead tissues of the burnt spots, blood is
deformed internally and the functions of different internal body systems collapse.
Duties of a first-aider
The first-aider should
the effects of thehyper-thermal object on
the body The victim should be taken away from the source and fire of the victim's dress should
be
out. It is better to cut open the dress so that the wholeness of the skin is not damaged. If
any part of the dress stick to the skin, it is better to
that part of the dress as it is. The victim
should not be laid bare. Especially in cold weather the patient
may
shocked. The burn injuries should be bandaged with
and sterilized bandage to avoid infections to the injuries.
Clean home clothes ironed and soaked in ethyl spirit or
potasium permanganate solution may be used as bandage. The
bandage may give a bit of relief from inflammation Moreover;
ice or ice-cool water may be used for the wounds so that heat
maynot penetrate deep into the body The victim's body should
becoveredwith warm clothes andhelshe should be given warm
drinks. The victim should better be removed to hospital. The victim should bekept still and in
comfortable posture. The first-aider should keep vigil tilla doctor attends the victim
What should not be done: (i) Atall cost the victim should bekept away from dirt and filth.
(ii) The burnt spot should not be touched; blisters should not be pricked with needle to drain out
water; the part of the clothes sticking to the burnt spots should not be removed by force;
ointments (vaseline, fat oil, etc) should not be used in the burn injuries These things help neither

If the villagers, city dwellers and slum-dwellers come forward and abide by the safety rules and
do one's duty rightly at the right times, we may be able to enrich the fire extinguishing systems in
schools, society and the state As a result of that loss of property, wealth and life may be
stopped and restricted. To strengthen the fire safety we should work like volunteers  Active and
co-operative role of each and everyone is necessary. The Government has introduced new fire
safety laws Lets us build a fire-proof society for allby our united efforts.

Bite
Dog-bite may sometimes be dangerous  Dog-bite may prove fatal. If domestic or_
are
given vaccines, there may be less risk . But the modern medical science does not say that it is
completely free from danger Modern medical science advises that the victim should be taken to
a health centre or hospital immediately The treatment should start without any negligence.
Generally, bites ofa
a cat, a fox anda wolf causehydrophobia. Bats and other animals may
this disease. Bite of a mad dog is the most dangerous. The saliva of a mad
contains
the germs ofhydrophobia called rabies virus. If the wounds of the bite are
O1
big, bleeding
may occur If the wounds are infected, the victim may havean attack of fever after two hours or
SO. Puss may form in the wound; it may swell and turn red.
Symptoms of dog-bite victim:

1.
Right quantity, right price =
The government has accepted several measures in order to
ensure right
and right quantity for the customers
The standard weights and the weight machines should bear proper marks or seals
from the department of measurement. It will speak for their accuracy
Formeasuring cloth etc. metal scales should beusedand
should bear legal marks
as a
proof of their accuracy
The measuring containrs should have legal marks on them as proof of accuracy, while
measureing kerosene oil or other liquids of thatkind:
Packaged products should bear on them the details like
name of the
product
(quantity, weight, number or volume), complete name and address of the manufacturer, manu-
facturing date, maximum retail price and also complete address of the authority to be addressed
in case of any fault.
It should be remembered that taking higher_
than the one mentioned on the packet is
illegal and punishable offence.

In order to prevent adulteration in food the Government of Indian had compiled two laws;
first The Prevention of FoodAdulteration Act, 1954 and later the modified and extended ver-
sion ofit-
The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. In this act special attention has been

given on physical safety and control and prohibitions have been attributed to marketing of food,
so that
ofadulterated food can be controlled and legal steps can be taken against dishon-
est traders.
The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 has ascribed some controls and prohibition in case of
selling medicines so that selling of wrong or adulterated medicines can be stopped, as wellas
necessary legal actions can be taken against dishonest traders.
According to The
and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954
control and prohibition have been attributed to advertisements of immoral and magic remedies;
provisions for necessary legal steps against dishonest traders have also been mentioned in it
In the field of medical services The Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Eti-
quette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 has enforced necessary directions for the interest of con-
sumners.
Here are some examples
Nutritional values and the date before which it would be the best should be mentioned

Preventive Measures
The government has startedanew court so that the defrauded customers can
the easi-
estand quickest remedies at minimum expense. These courts which are meant to settle the clash
between the buyer and the seller are called the `Consumer Forum
The Consuemr Protection Act, 1986
This act received the approval from the president of
India on 24th December, 1986. Hence the day 24th December is observed as the National
Consumer
in India to commemorate the historic attempt to maintain and secure the interest
of consumers.
However before the introduction of this act, there have been many other acts; but these
acts did not have any
provision for-
remedies or compensation for the consumers  Provi-
sions for proper compensation for the defrauded consumers were included in The Consumer
Protection
1986 for the first time.
But this act would be applicable for those customers only who would
for their own
use and not for business purpose.
Other than that, this act would also facilitate those who are engaged in a business through
self-employment only for earning livelihood:
In this act these buyers have been described as
Consumers
Consumer-nominated users
or even those who
enjoy the servicec or convenience wouldalso beregarded as consumers Six
rights of the consumers have been accepted by the act
(a)   Right to protectionagainst the marking of goods or services which are harmful to life or
property
Right to information about the quality, quantity, purity, utility, চ
of the product or
service.
Right to select
Right to hearing
Right to get remedy
Right to consumer education.
The benefit of this act is that the consuemrhimself or through his rominated representative
can complain or present his proposal; appointing a layer is not compulsory.

Procedure to lodge a complaint in the Consumer Forum :
Atleast three charge sheets written appropriately and extra copies which must equalize the
number of accused persons should be submitted to the concerned forum.
Little amount of fee is required to submit the charge sheet. The amount depends on the
claim
No fee is
required to lodge complaint for the claim up to Rs 1 lakh if the consumer is
Antodaya Anno Yojna cardholder or belongs to BPL category
If the charge is found to be correct, then it is ordered to repair or replace the defective
material, to ensure proper service, to refund the
of the material or service or even to
compensate if the consumer is harmed due to the
negligence of the seller or the service provider
Special initiative by the Government of West Bengal
Ifthe consumers wish, then instead
oflodging complaint in the consumer forum,
can
appeal
before the consumer department to have a mutual undertanding. In that case the officers ofthe
consuemr department try to settle the issue by having a discussion in the presence ofboth
the
buyer and the seller Quick settlement is achieved in many cases. The main benefit of this
is that the entire process goes on without any expense, i.e. no fee is required to appeal for
mutual settlement

CHAPTER _ V
Disaster Management
5.1.1. Flood
Temporary inundation of a
area ofland due to different reasons is known as flood  Flood
is the most common example of natural disaster worldwide. Flood occurs in most of the riverines
inour
country Floods generally occur in rivers, rivulets, lakes and small water reservoirs when
the water exceeds the capacity due to heavy rainfall Flood waters generally inundate the land
and its current damages, destroy and sweeps away the properties of the residents. Generally
floodhazard can be minimized by afforestation, constructing dams, embankments, flood walls,
deepening rivers by removing silt and constructing spill ways. The main aim of controlling flood
is to save the loss oflife and property from flood _
5.1.2.
Causes of Flood
Torrential rain is the most frequent cause of floods which leads to overflow of water from
river banks, breaching of embankments and collapse of dams. This inundates wide areas ofthe
land
i)   The water carrying capacity of the river
decreases ifthe river course is choked, ifthe channel
is narrowed down, or due to excessive siltation or if,
the river changes its normal course. This disturbs the
equilibrium oftheriverand theexcess water overflows
its banks
; leading to a disastrous flood:
1ii)
Excessive rainfall also causes flash floods,
especially in mountainous
Excessive rainfall
on the mountainous regions causes flash floods that

1v)
Lack ofproper drainage system that can dispose off the rain waters quickly and efficiently
to the nearest rivers, lakes or reservoirs is another important reason of flooding
Substantial water level of rivers rises due to melting ofice and can cause flooding  Global
warming due to urbanization is speeding up the melting of ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps that
increase the risk of disastrous floodevents.
In the coastal regions cyclones, high waves and tides forecast flood and cause flooding of
the coastal_
regions.
vii)   Earthquakes under the sea causes huge amount of water to
into the coastal regions
which is also called Tsunami and causes deadly floods withina few moments
viii)   Flooding also occurs temporarily near the
or the river mouth during tidal waves.
ix)   Majority of the drains in the cities and townships arehighly exposed to misuse by residents
ofthe
who dispose of allkinds of solid waste into them, choke them with filth and this also
causes floods.
Vulnerability to flood is also related to the geomorphologic set up of the
Most of
the rivers of our country cause floods and most flood prone areas are in the North-Eastern
regions More than 60% of flood events occur in these regions where 47% ofthe country's total
population resides.
X1)
Floods are also caused due to climatic factors As in our country, the monsoon pours
heavy rain from June to September During this time 75% of the annual rainfall is precipitated
which rapidly raises the water level of the rivers and lakes that increases the vulnerability of
floods and inundation of thelowlying areas.
5.1.3. Damages caused by Flood
Damages to residential property and public infrastructure
The huge amount of flood
waters devastate property and infrastructure and instigate landslide due to water logging Coastal
flooding destroys and damages the fishing boats and fisheries, which are sometimes totally wiped
off Houses with poor foundations and mud walls are easily damaged and even destroyed that
result in loss of property and hampers life of the occupants
11)
Loss oflife and public health : Drowning in flood waters causes death both to humans,
animals and livestock; sometimes causes fatal injuries. There also exists the potential for
transmission of water-borne diseases, viruses and increases the levels ofendemic diseases like
respiratory infectious diseases, cholera, malaria and diarrhoea.

111)
Hamper water supply and crisis of drinking water
Water in wells, groundwater and
water supply system all get polluted that result in the scarcity of drinking water:
iv)   Damage to agriculture and shortage of food : Floods destroy several agricultural lands
that adversely affect food production and is inextricably linked with food insufficiency Atthe
same time animal fodder is also destroyed Flood-waters invade the granaries and other food
storage infrastructure which initiates scarcity of foods.
Damage to agricultural lands : Flood water often changes the properties of the soil, erodes
the topsoil or inundation of agricultural lands by salty waters reduces the fertility of the soil:
5.1.4. Remedial measures to minimize losses in
flooding
1)
Floodwaters can be brought under control through wetlands, natural and manmade reser-
voirs, construction of dams and alternate spillways and afforestation. Preventive measures also
include de-siltation of rivers and plantation of trees
11)
In flood situations, the hazard can be minimized easily if residents in that area can be
evacuated in time and rehabilitated somewhere else. Large scale developmental works should
not be permitted in flood affected and potential flood risk zones. Schools, hospitals, panchyat
offices and other important public places should be constructed in protected areas
111)
Dams should be maintained properly and efficiently to control the storage and release of
water
iv)   Buildings andhouses can be constructed on elevated lands and should be ata safe distance
from water bodies  Buildings and houses should be flood-proof and flood-rescue constructions
should be erected for public interest
During floods cultivation can be carried out with the then available natural seeds.
During flood alerts, immediate steps should be taken up to move to the nearest specified
safe places.
5.1.5. Preparedness of Students to Mitigate flood Hazards
Flood zone maps and flood forecast
Students can easily prepare flood zonation maps
to indicate the floodprone areas that can substantially minimize floodhazards.
Early records of flood can easily demonstrate the time, intensity and spread of the flood in the
flood prone areas. Early flood records and maps when blended with the base map of the area,


## Page 79 of physical education
66
Health
Physical Education
proper assessment can be made of that flood prone region. If there is an indication of flood, then
based on previous year's floodheight record, forecasting can be made and accordingly an alert
may be sounded An idea can be generated about the flood prone area by knowing the wave
height and character of the landscape in coastal regions. The floodhazard zone map also give an
idea regarding the water currents during floods. On these maps the safe places can be marked
which helps to take immediate shelter during floods.
11)
Training for implementing renovation strategies
Protection of trees, cleaning up silt
and pebbles from water ways, repair and restoration of lakes and ponds, etc. can control floods
and prevent the susceptibility of being flooded
To decrease the intensity of floods, students can work together to clear the waterways like
drains, etc. of the affected areas Students can obtain
training to bring into control the flood
water currents and work as a team member of the highly trained flood mitigation squad and
understand the procedures of constructing river embankments and flood walls, stacking of sand

5.1.6. Flood Hazard Management Planning
Construction of dams and reservoirs and their proper management, proper spillways, etc. and
plantation of trees help to control and reduce the floodwater hazards. Dredging and removal of
silts, afforestation, etc. can be the major curriculum of public sectors and N.GOs  There should
be support for the rehabilitation of people affected by floods. There should be a vigilance that
the poor people should not try to settle near the river banks and there should be laws to enforce
this. Schools, hospitals, panchayat offices, etc. should be constructed at protected places Houses
and other constructions should be made such that
are able to withstand flood hazards
Natural disasters are inevitable and cannot be stopped, but they can be brought under control.
To prevent natural disasters is to manage and mitigate it Management and mitigation ofhazards
is the way oflife.
To formulate themanagement and mitigation programmes for pre-, syn-and post-naturalhazards,
there should be nine well-coordinated committees consisting of students, teachers, guardians,
women's executive committee, youth leaders andNGO workers and each working group should
consist of 6-10 active members. The names and the function ofeach committee are detailed

Actions of the flood alert committee-
a.
Alert before the onset of flood:
Continuously listening to the radio, watching the television and wireless forecasting of
alerts by the administration should be done.
With the sound ofalert thepeople should be informed immediately throughloud speakers
or any other devices. Cycles, bullock carts, boats or any other available vehicles can be
used.
It should be ensured that this committee possesses the address and telephone numbers
ofthenearby administrative offices.
b.
During flood (when flood alert has been sounded)
Alert should be communicated to all the area, especially, to those places which are
marked as danger zones.
Immediate contact should be made to the rehabilitation camps.
Post-flood situation
Know the flood situation through radio.
Make people aware of the various health problems and their remedies.
Constant consulting e g , with rehabilitation and rescue committee and also with other
committees and seek their help
2.
Other working groups or committees
There are other groups like patrolling group, communicating group, police volunteers, various
other volunteer groups and relief collecting group, etc. It is not expected or mandatory that each
and every student should work in every group but
should be attached to that group in which
feel comfortable. It is the prime duty of
the members of the working groups that each
and every student should be safe during their
work execution
This is because today's
students are the future citizens of the nation

Road traffic safety
6.1.1. Role of Traffic Police in Road-Traffic Safety
Trafficpolice is anicon ofhonesty and
responsibility We are always used to see
traffic police controlling road traffics and
7
vehicles under the scorchingheat ofthe sun,
heavy rains or in severe winters. The traf-
fic police are always careful to prevent ac-
cidents of vehicles and pedestrians. The
traffic police honestly and continuously
work to prevent accidents in cities and
metros. The traffic police are harsh to the
drivers and pedestrians who try to break
the rules  However,
are actually sympathetic to the people and the society From our daily
experience we have seen that the traffic police take the lead role to help the children,
people and physically challenged individuals to cross the roads safely The traffic police never
hesitate to stop the vehicles and help people to cross the roads by holding their hands. On the
other hand, if any accident occurs then the traffic
immediately rush there to help the
injuredand try to
the situation under controlas quickly, tactfully and smoothly as possible.
Not only this, the traffic police also take thekey role to direct vehicles and pedestrians who are
stangers to the area. Recently
have formulateda curriculum to train the school students to
make them aware of the road-traffic safety Every year the Road Safety Week'
is celebrated
from lst January to 7th January to make people aware of the road-traffic safety Thus the traffic
police help to save life of both the pedestrians and vehicle drivers and so we can call them as our
helper, saviour and friend.

Road
Markings
Dividing line or Median strip
A
dividing line or median strip or divider is a road marking
formedbya white or
yellow line designed to separate the road when vehicles are travelling in
opposite directions. The width of the median strip depends upon the width of the road. The
main aim of this median line is to divide the road into two parts. This is done in order to prevent
any accidents on the road between vehicles travelling in opposite directions.
Theroads
having median strip painted in yellow indicates that the vehicle should not cross this
line in any situation. On the otherhand the same marking in white indicates that the vehicle can
cross thewhiteline only if situation permits, however, such crossings
arenotencouraged These dividers arepainted ontheroad to prevent
head-on collision between vehicles moving in opposite directions.
Lane lines
Various types of vehicles move on the road likelight
weight vehicle, heavier vehicles and moderate speed vehicles. If
the vehicles that move with moderate speed are
allowed to
move
along theroads without proper signals then accidents, casualty
and
congestion are inevitable. To avoid these troubles, the
road is sub-divided
by broken or discrete lines into many sub-lanes. This is called lane
divisions  Roads where these sub-lanes are marked, the vehicle should be driven accordingly in
the specific lane depending onits
Hence, high speed vehicles should move on the extreme
right sub-lane and the slowest along the extreme left sub-lane. Thus buses, mini-buses, autos,
etc that need to stop frequently for passengers should move on the extreme left sub-lane Apart
from this, vehicless should wait for signals if there is a crossing ahead:
6.1.4. Traffic Police Directions and Traffic Light Signals
a)
When the traffic police holds a STOP signal then it indicates that up and down move-
ment of vehicles along that particular road is stopped, however, vehicles can move
towards right or left  After a certain interval of time, the traffic police will change
position and the STOP road will be opened for vehicles to move
and the open
road will face the STOP signal.

Traffic Light Signals: The rules and regulations for road traffic are indicated by light
signals that are controlled by the traffic police.
The red signal prohibits any traffic from proceeding and the vehicle should wait behind
the stop line.

The yellow light provides warning that the signal will be changing from

With the blinking of yellow light the vehicle must be slowed down and it should wait

Some tips for improving your vision and driving ability at night
Before youhit the road, check that allexterior lights work properly (front and rear, brake
lights and high beams) , and ensure your windows and headlights are clean (inside and
outside) Dirty windows can add to glare and impair vision, making it more difficult to see;
dirty headlights can greatly reduce efficiency

Advantages of Driving at Night :
You'll usually achieve a higher average speed, despite maintaining a lower
speed.
Primary reason is lesser traffic.
Lower probability of bullock carts, three wheelers,
and animals on the Highway
Cooler airkeeps engine better! The density of coolair is higher than hotair Thus, you end
up witha
superior burn, resulting in better performance. The engine feels noticeably
at
night
Higher fuel efficiency due to lesser traffic and cooler air
You can seea vehicle
coming around a blind corner due to its headlamps (assuming the
vehiclehas its headlamps running).
This is down to personal tastes, but some find night
driving very enjoyable. The pleasure
of empty roads, cooler weather; crisper engine, feeling one with the car and some nice
music playing is unmatched However; safety comes first and it s best to limit night driving
to as little as
possible.

7.1.2 Marching
Marching is one of the best among all the formal physical activities. Marching is the combination
of standing in files, walking, changing of direction while walking and moving following the commnads
of the commander To maintain discipline is the prime factor to lead a smooth and healthy life. The
foundation of personality and wisdom in a human being is built with the sense of discipline. We all should
take care so that we can grasp the art of sitting, standing, walking etc in proper posture.
Marching not only improves the physical and mental state of a person, develops the society but
also adds attraction to the annual function of an educational institution, reception ceremony of a special
guest, inaugural ceremony of a sports championship.

On
hearing this command the athelete is to come up to
starting block already placed just behind the starting line from the Assembly line
drawn 3 mt behind the
starting line. The athlete will sit on the starting block placing
the feet on the two steps Now the hands are to be placed on the ground just behind
the starting line and the body weight is to be transferred on the hands
The front
foot will be comparatively strong (generally left leg) which will be placed
11/2' to
2' back from the strating line depending on the length of the torso of the athlete.
If the torso is big the front foot is to be placed 2
back
from the strating line,
otherwise 11/2'
will serve the purpose
Then the other foot is to be placed in such
a manner so that the knee of that

front foot or beside the heel of the front foot It depends on the length of the lower
of the body To obtain maximum mechanical advantage the difference of the
two steps of the block may be set in three different distance
The shortest distance
between the two steps is called
'Bullet' start position, next is called Bunch' start
position and if the distance between two steps on the block is maximum it is called
'Elongated'
start position Now the fingers of the hands
are to
be placed just
behind the starting line.
The two thumbs will remain face to face towards the body
and the other four
fingers of both the hands will remain away from the body and
those four fingers will remain clung together The index finger and the thumb will
look like
a tick (P)
mark.
The difference of two arms will
be
a little more than
the shoulder length. The head is to be kept downwards and the vision will remain
a little ahead of the
starting line
(ii) (Set'
From `On Your Marks' position the hip is to be lifted slowly
a little
above the shoulder so that
a 90' angle is formed at the front knee-joint and 1000
to 110' angle at the rear leg knee-joint. The body weight is to be transferred from
the feet to fingers of the two arms so that the centre of gravity remains a little ahead
of the starting line
Now, the body is to be kept stationary and full
concentration 1s to be given
for
hearing the next
command. In this
of time the centre of gravity
of the body is to be transferred slowly towards front
SO that
owing to the disturbance of body balance
a sensation is felt within the body
The advantage
of this state of body is that the body can achieve
a
flying start with
a
little thrust of the rear foot
In this state head is to be bent

Finishing
Nowadays in the international meets judgement at the finishing line of short distance
running events is taken through (Photo-finish' and so the necessity of learning high
quality techniques has increased. The following two finishing techniques for running
events
are extensively used
(a) At the time of finishing the athlete will run aiming at an imaginery finishing
line 10 mt away from the original finishing line so that
the athlete can maintain highest
at the
finishing
line
(b) To lean forward the body at the finishing point.
In this technique at the time of taking the last stride
just before touching the finishing line, the chest and the
trunk are stretched forward in a jerk by bringing down
both
the
arms
backward
with
a
force.
This
technique is very fruitful if it is properly practised If

Gliding is essential to
velocity and momentum towards the direction
of delivery
The co-ordination of the movement of the right and left
towards the
direction of delivery is very important This gliding action starts with the back thrust
of the left

How to record the moves in a game of chess
We can note down each move while playing a game of chess in order to study the
moves later on. If you know the
following rules, you can easily note them down
File, Rank and Diagonal
8

We can divide the chess board into eight verti-
cal lines as well as in eight horizontal lines There

are
eight squares
the vertical lines; these are
called FILEs. The FILEs are marked as a, b, C, d,
3
e, f, g andh. The square along the horizontal lines
Runk
are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and ৪. The slanted

lines are called diagonals.

Names of different squares: Each and every
square of the chess board has a name of its own
These squares belong either to a FILE

The names of the squares are
coined from the names of Files and Ranks. For
example, the square al in under File-a

This symbol denotes Long Castlel Queenside Castling
How to note down the moves of the Pawn: There is no symbol to note down the
moves of the Pawns So to record the move of the Pawn, the File name of the move is
noted down Basically, we note down the name of the square where the Pawn moves.
For
example, if the Pawn moves two squares ahead of the
we simply note down
the move as e4. Otherwise, Xis used to denote captures and at the same time the name
of the square that the Pawn occupied is mentioned:
For
example, if a Pawn of e4
captures a Pawn at f5, the move is written as eXf5.
If one reaches the last Rank, one may replace the Pawn with another piece.
The new
piece is indicated by the notation `=' and the move is noted down by the name of the
square
occupied. For example, if the white pawn at g7 is replaced by the queen at g8,
the notation should be g8=0.
Notations of the movements of other pieces:
Of the pieces of Chess, all except
the pawns have a
particular notation/symbol to identify them While
down the
moves the
symbol of the pieces and the squares occupied combine together to name
them. For
example, if the queen moves from d4 to h8, then the move is noted as 'Qh8'
In cases of capture the
X' symbol is used between names of the square and the
notation. For example, QXh8.

In the year 1933 in
a
meeting at Sikim and Maharastra rules and
regulations of Kho-Kho
were framed and
since then these rules
are
followed everywhere in India
The game of Kho-Kho requires the highest level of endurance) agility and presence

as
a
breach of rule.
Single Chain Defence Technique: Single chain defensive technique is one of the most
important defensive system of the runners
When the chasers chase runner to make him
out, the runner adopts zigzag course by crossing the central lane through every back
of the
chasers to defend himself from
touched by the active chaser. In this
technique the runner crosses

the   basic
skills
Kicking
This is the most essential skill to send a ball to any distance short,
medium or long for passing, clearing or shooting at
A ball can be kicked
when it is in stationary or in
running condition. Kicking a running ball is more
complicated than kicking a stationary ball because to kick
a
running ball
a
player is to adjust the position of his body calculating the direction and velocity
of the ball almost in
no time.
The followings
are the basic
principles for kicking a
ball.
a)
The non-kicking foot will remain 6" to 8" away from inches the ball.
b
The body is to be bent
a
little and the head will remain still above the
ball.
The kicking foot will come from the back with a swing
and the
arm
opposite to the kicking foot
will be in front
and the other
at the back
(d) The ball can be hit with the inside of the foot, outside
of the foot, instep of the foot or sometimes with the toes
or heel.
The ankle, knee and hip joints of the kicking foot shall
be kept strong
Different   Techniques
of  Kicking

Ball
Kicking the ball with the inside of the foot
The non-
kicking foot is to be kept

(ii) Kicking the
ball
with
the outside
of the foot
This technique is also known as `outstep kick
The
of the kicking foot
just below the smallest toe is used to take an outstep kick.
The swing of
the
kicking foot will be from the back and position of the foot will be inside
out.
Other actions will
be similar to the former technique
(iii) Instep Kick-Low drive
The position of the non-kicking foot will be
samne as
kicking the ball with inside of the foot The player will come towards
the ball
running from 4 to 5 steps back. Keeping the non-kicking foot beside
the ball the instep of the kicking foot will hit the centre-point of the vertical
midline of the ball.
At the time of kicking the toes are to be kept hard and
the ankle joint will be opened completely
The
kicking foot is to be moved
forward after
hitting the ball and the body will lean forward and the arms
will be stretched alongside to maintain body balance. This technique is used
to make the ball travel with
all along the ground
(iv) Instep Kick-High drive
The
non-kicking foot is to be kept 1" ft. back
and 6"-8" away from the line of the ball. The player is to run
4 to 6 steps

to reach the ball. The kicking foot is to be brought from
the back with a great swing to hit the ball just under the horizontal midline
with the instep keeping the upper
of the body straight and vision towards
the direction of the target and hands alongside the body The kicking foot
is to be stretched a little upward in the follow through. This
technique is used
to make the ball travel in the air in a desired trajectory with a force as
Chip shot (kick)
This technique is used for kicking the ball high in
the air so that 1t lands within
a
short distance
It is generally used to give
a
pass
over the head of an opponent player
or to place
the
ball towards

short but fast swing to hit the
bottom of the ball.
The
body will be bent
a little over the ball.
B.

the pass This pass is given
direct
to the co-player
or in
a
gap
SO that
a
teammate can receive the pass by running
a few
steps To give a short pass
a
player pushes the ball lightly with the instep
or the outstep
(ii) Long Pass
Generally
passes are given through the air to a teammate

This kind
of pass is given to open up the game or to switch over the game from left
to right
or vice versa. Excellence and
perfection are the basic needs
to execute this skill effectively
(iii) Square Pass
When the co-players
within 15 to 20
distance
this pass may be played to build-up an attack or to kill time with an intention
in  combination
with
other kinds of short passes
(iv) Diagonal Pass
This kind of pass is played diagonally aiming at a gap
at 20 to 30
so that a teammate can receive it coming from behind. This
diagonal pass is also given directly to
a
teammate.
Through
Pass
It is generally
a
middle distance pass Using instep or
outstep the ball is to be hit in such a
way that the ball travels all along the
ground passing through two

players.
C
Trapping
Before passing, dribbling or kicking a ball during a game the ball
needs to be trapped most of the time. Trapping can be done with different
techniques according to the speed, height and direction of the ball.
A ball
can be controlled by trapping with the foot, thigh, chest, belly and head as
the situation demand.
Trapping
with foot
Foot trapping is done
different parts of the
foot depending on the pace, height etc
of the ball. The parts usually used
for foot trapping are (a) sole of the foot, (b) instep of the foot, (c) outside
of the
foot
and (d) inside of the
foot.
Sole-trapping is used to control a ball running all along the ground The other
three techniques are used to control high balls.
The main objective of this
trapping is to control
a
high ball and
it down to the ground quickly

go-out of control due to stiffness of the muscles Just at the time of contact
with the ball the foot will act like a cushion by keeping all the joints of the
foot loose and in
no time the foot will have to be detached from the ball.
(ii) Thigh Trapping
To control
a
high ball this technique of trapping is
used. In this trapping the thigh is to be brought under the ball in such a manner
that the ball
comes to the contact of the middle of thigh and the moment
the ball touches the thigh it is to be detached to avoid rebound: Folding the
knee the thigh is to be lifted up to
a level
parallel to the ground and after
the
contact with the ball the thigh is to be brought down
(iii) Chest Trapping
When
a
ball comes in a high trajectory the ball is
controlled by chest trapping

laurels for India at international archery competitions
However, her dream of representing India in archery would
have never have come true had it not been for the
unfliching
support of her father, the financial support received from the
Kanyashree scheme
Monika comes from the Santhal
community that is mired
in poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and malnutrition
Underage marrage is the norm, and the education of girls is
rarely considered. Her father is the sale earnner in a six-member
family, and financial hardship is a way of life for the Sorens
Fartunately for Monika, her father borrowed money to sustain
her passion, risking community censure and social ostracism
to allow her to pursue her career as an international level archer

Despite her

continues. The Kanyashree annual scholarship made it possible for her to hire private

commitments. In 2015 she received the one time grant of Rs. 25,000, which she has
used for buying equipment Further, on Kanyashree
August 14, 2015, the
Chief Minister presented her with a sedt of arrows, the price of which was out of her

10.2.2 Awareness Campaign on Environment Cleanliness
Introduction:
Cleanliness is must in today's world as we all live in such in a
society and obviously
if our home or work place is not clean one can't
into it. The term
environment' means
the surrounding habitat of man. In its widest sense, it refers to the entire earth with its green
forests, vast oceans, the layers of air and oxygen, etc In its narrowest
meaning, environment
means the immediate surroundings of man
his home, work place, market, neighborhood,
etc. It also includes the atmosphere in which he lives According to many scientists, the
factor which influences the growth of individuals most is environment. But unfortunately,
the various elements of
environment such
as,
water, land, etc
are
polluted and
contaminated. Environmental pollution is ` the contamination of the physical and biological
components of the earth atmosphere system to such
extent that normal environmental
processes are adversely affected'
Good habits for resistance of disease and better quality of lifestyle:
Everyday brush your teeth after lunch and dinner
Everyday clean your body by taking bath with clean water and soap
Regular clean your hair by soap or shampoo.
Always wear clean cloths. Change your cloths when you return from market or school.

Need of sanitation for resistance of disease and infection
1.
Different direction of disease and infection:
a.
Infectious disease through hands: We do various types work through hands Washing
O1
sanitizing hands helps to prevent the spread of infections Even though hands may look
clean,
are always picking up germs, carrying them around and leaving them behind on
the common
that you touch every day Your hands pick up germs when you do everyday
things like coughing or sneezing into hands, touching door handles and light switches,
preparing food, changing diapers, and playing with toys, to name a few
Germs like to enter your body through your eyes, nose, and mouth and 80% of common
infections are caught when you touch your eyes, nose and mouth with hands that are loaded
with germs
Other people can also
sick from the germs your unwashed hands leave
behind on the common
you touch every
Washing your hands (or
alcohol based hand rub) is the best way to
rid of
germs and protect yourself against many infections including the common cold and the flu.
Cleaning your hands will help you stay healthy and will protect others from getting sick

b
Infectious disease through water: Another name of water is life. Because we did not
alive without water
Water-borne diseases are any illness caused by drinking
water
contaminated by human or animal faces, which contain pathogenic microorganisms. Water,
sanitation and hygiene have important impacts on both health and disease. The most frequent
causes of food or water-borne illnesses are various bacteria, viruses and parasites
Water-
borne diseases are thought to be the most common of all acute illnesses
Symptoms vary
with the causative agent and range from slight abdominal
and nausea to
retching,
vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever and diarrhoea Fever, chills, headache, malaise and
muscular pains may accompany gastrointestinal
symptoms. Vomiting, with or without diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and fever are common
symptoms of viral disease or staphylococcal intoxication
Certain food-borne illnesses can
present with meningitis or septicaemia or with neurological symptoms Access to clean water

C
Infectious disease through green fruits and vegetables: Fruits and vegetables
provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber that your body needs They're also packed with
hundreds of disease-fighting phytochemicals
natural substances that work as
a team to
protect
health
While the exact mechanisms of specific phytochemicals
are
studied, one thing is clear: the different colors of fruits and vegetables
green, yellow-
orange, red, blue-purple, and white
all contain
থ
array of disease-fighting
phytochemicals that work together with vitamins and minerals to protect our health But
several times the fruits and
vegetables are not fresh because maximum time they drop down
in the market in open air condition or
pesticide's makes it unhealthy for our life. So before
prepare any food this should wash properly and then cook. Sometimes we eat some fruits
and vegetables green, often
did not digest properly and at the result we suffer indigestion
problem.
d. Infectious disease through insects: insects liken mosquitoes, lice, fleas, bed bugs
and ticks are able to transmit a number of diseases caused by infectious agents: viruses
(chikungunya virus, yellow fever, dengue fever, etc), bacteria (Lyme disease, plague, etc),
parasites (malaria, sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, filariasis, etc) Of the many diseases
by insects, very few
are actually caused by the insects themselves but rather, by
other organisms passed on when
feed or bite. Insects are
capable of spreading diseases
caused by many different types of micro-organisms including bacteria, viruses, protozoans,
etc. In these instances it is the micro-organism that is the pathogen (disease causer) and the
insect involved is known as the vector
Biting insects are active at all times of the
and
night. However, some prefer different times of
eg the
mosquitoes that spread malaria
are mainly active after dark but the mosquitoes that
yellow fever and dengue fever
are active
during daylight hours Infections may be transmitted through Lizards, rats,
Cockroach,
and other insects or1 animals.
Some precautions would be taken for this type of infections
Wear loose fitting, light
coloured clothes (insects can reach skin through tight clothing),
trousers and long
sleeves Don't go barefoot, mosquitoes are most active, so it's important to cover up in the
evenings in malaria risk regions Clean surrounding regularly and use disinfection aids like
phenyl, DDT Powder, Dettol, Naphthalene etc use properly
2.
Cleanliness in Home: It is rightly said that cleanliness is next to godliness Cleanliness
is the finest human endeavor It should become the way of our life and we should include
the noble habit from the very early days Cleanliness is an integral aspect of our sustenance
and progress As dirt is a blot in our
living, we should give priority to eliminate it from our
lives As a rudimentary step, our environment must be cleaned in all aspects We should not
litter garbage here and there We must always keep one
in our mind that our actions
should not be a hurdle for anyone's comfort
Healthy living denotes clean surrounding and
purity in thoughts Cleanliness is the stepping stone of progress

3.
Safe preservation of drinking water and use: Water is essential for life. The amount
of drinking water required is variable. It depends on physical activity, age, other health
problems, and environmental conditions
Those
working in
a hot climate up to 16 liters

may be required Typically in
developed countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards, even though only a
small proportion is actually consumed or d in food preparation Other typical uses include
washing, toilets, and irrigation Reduction of waterborne leases and development of safe
water resources is a major
public health
in developing countries
The
Jinking water
contribution to mineral nutrients intake is also unclear Inorganic minerals generally enter
surface water and ground water via storm water runoff or through the Earth's crust. Treatment
processes also lead to re presence of some minerals Examples include calcium, zinc,
manganese, phosphate, fluoride and sodium compounds Springs are often used as sources
for bottled waters
water, delivered by domestic water systems in developed nations,
refers to water piped to homes and delivered to a tap or spigot For these water sources to be
consumed safely
must receive adequate treatment and meet drinking water regulations.
Access to safe drinking water is indicated by proper sanitary sources These improved
drinking water sources include household connection,
standpipe, borehole condition,
protected
well, protected spring, and rain
water collection
Unprotected wells,
unprotected springs, rivers, ponds or overhead water tank, and tanker truck water can be
harmful for health Access to sanitary water comes hand in hand with access to improved
sanitation facilities for excreta These facilities include connection to public sewer,
connection to
system, pour-flush latrine,
and ventilated improved pit latrine
Unimproved sanitation facilities are:
or shared latrine, open pit latrine, or bucket
latrine
4.
Safe drawing out of treated water: In today's home, we use water in lots of ways We
use water for various purposes for our daily life like bathing, washing cooking utensils,
vegetables and fruits, garments, cleaning rooms, watering of houseplants etc
Women are

lot of diseases The water-related human health issues has become increasingly
comprehensive, with the emergence of new water-related infection diseases spread through
water, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases which include salmonellosis, cholera,
shigellosis, malaria.
Poor sanitation,
water and hygiene have many other serious
repercussions. Children
and particularly girls
are denied their right to education because
their schools lack private and decent sanitation facilities So, for storage this treated water

particular soak pit or drawing out through drain. This treated water can be
used for garden or kitchen garden through a suitable planning. If there is no proper drainage
system a permanent water soaking dig can made for the house hold purpose.
5.
Safe drawing out of litter: There are so many litters deposit in house every
for
house hold purpose like vegetables
of skin, scale offish, bones, paper
leafs etc
Lac of regular house cleaning and drawing out litters the environment of house may be
polluted and disturbance of fly, mosquito various types of insects, rats,
cats will be
increased and also various types of disease should be formed.
For safe drawing of litters a pit can made on the soil, around 4 feet length and width and
3 feet depth and put all litters into this garbage and when it is totally loaded
it by soil.
Cow

into this pit After one year it would be putrefied it should be make
compost fertilizer which very effective for garden. So, construction of this type of fertilizer
pit is very easy and yours home will be became healthful.
6.
Safe drawing out of excreta: Human excreta and the lack of adequate personal and
domestic hygiene have been implicated in the transmission of many infectious diseases
including cholera, diarrhea, typhoid, hepatitis, polio, cryptosporidiosis, ascariasis, and
chistosomiasi  Proper excreta disposal and minimum levels of personal and domestichygiene
are
essential for protecting public and also child health Once pathogens have been introduced
into the environment
can be transmitted via either the mouth (eg through drinking
contaminated water or eating contaminated vegetables food) or the skin (as in the case of
the hookworms and schistosomes), although in many cases adequate personal and domestic
hygiene can reduce such transmission
Therefore for maximum health protection, it is
important to treat and contain human excreta as close to the source as possible before it gets
introduced into the environment
For practical purposes sanitation can be divided into on-site and off-site technologies
On-site systems (eg latrines) store andlor treat excreta at the
of generation In off-
site systems (e g sewerage), excreta is transported to another location for treatment, disposal

Safe preservation of food and use: We live through eating food and also we suffer few
diseases through intake food.
So food protection and food preservation have one aim in
common
are intended to prevent contamination and spoilage of foods All food must
be protected at all times
storage and preparation from the following contaminants:
any
water that is not known to be safe, including overhead leaks and drips, dirty hands,
coughing and sneezing, dust and soot, flies, rodents and other vermin, insecticides and
other chemicals, unclean utensils and
work surfaces, cigarette smoke. Anyone handling
food should avoid bad habits such as scratching,
touching the hair; nose or mouth,
unclean hair, unclean and
fingernails, smoking, and coughing or sneezing in food
handling and preparation areas
should always wash their hands before starting to
prepare food, and after every interruption, particularly after using the toilet People who
have skin infections, diarrhea or sore throats should avoid handling food
There are other general principles for preventing food contamination:
All water used in food preparation should be wholesome.
All dishes, glasses and utensils must be kept clean by regular washing in clean
water, and clean utensils should be kept covered
All surfaces that come into contact with food should be meticulously clean
Food storage, preparation and serving areas should be free of pets, rats, mice and
insects.
Food should be covered, and kept separate from chemicals and poisons (which
should be clearly labeled).
Cloths that come into contact with dishes and utensils, and that are used to cover
food, need to be changed daily and boiled before use
8.
Clean hands by soap after latrine: One cannot deny that toilets are an important part
of living
Substances that are not need or
are harmful to the body are passed out These
wastes are harmful and
poisonous and can be used as agents in disease spreading. It is thus
important to dispose well of these wastes so that
do not pose a threat to human health
Toilets are visited by users to wash their hands or to check their appearances in the bathroom
mirror: It is important that the toilet is maintained well with a high standard of hygiene so
that germs are not easily spread Always aware every member of your family to wash hands
by soap or liquid soap for health and hygiene.

10.
Cutting nails regularly: Nails are made up of layers of protein called keratin and can
be indicative of our general health
grow on average 1
mm per week, unless there are
dietary issues or medical conditions that prevent this. The purpose of nails is to protect the
ends of our fingers and toes from trauma and to help pick things up Taking
care of
your nails and
maintaining their cleanliness is very important
As many people talk with
their hands

personal hygiene.
We should cut our nails regularly and keep them clean
The cleanliness

11. Regular brush teeth and bathing: Keeping your mouth healthy will help you to
other parts of your body healthy as well We should be brushing our teeth at least twice
every
once in the
morning and once before bed. Be sure to brush all of your teeth, even
the ones in the back that are hard to reach If you can do it yourself, you should floss your
teeth, too Whenever we eat, food can be left behind between our teeth, and this can cause
problems. Gently move the floss between each tooth in order to make sure your remove any
food or plaque left behind after brushing. It is a
idea to brush your tongue in order to
have fresh breath, too.
a
healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables will help to keep
your mouth and teeth clean
Bathing cleans the skin It also cleans the mucous mem-branes of the genital and anal
areas.
Complete or partial baths, tub baths, or showers are given Most people like having
their hair washed regularly

washing your body with soap and
washing your hair with shampoo. How often you take a bath or shower will depend on your
activities .
12. Leave home with
on shoes: Shoes protect your feet from
Shoes can protect
your feet from some acute injuries, but I've noticed that people step on nails with or without
shoes When your feet have a loss of protective sensation, the shoes (and socks) you wear
can either help you to live a healthy and productive life, or can contribute to repeated open
sores that may gradually lead to amputation
podiatrists believe that the number one
issue with not
wearing shoes is the lack of support offered to the foot and any damage that
can occur as a result.

Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) or oral rehydration salts or solutions (ORS) is a simple,
and effective treatment for diarrhea-related dehydration, caused by eg cholera. It
consists of a solution of salts and other substances such as glucose, sucrose, citrates or
molasses, which is administered orally It is used around the world, but is most important in
the Third World, where it saves millions of children from diarrhea
stills their
leading cause
of death. Oral Rehydration Therapy is the giving of fluid by mouth to prevent andlor correct
the
dehydration that is a result of diarrhea
As soon as diarrhea begins, treatment using
home remedies to prevent dehydration must be started. In the human body, water is absorbed
and secreted passively; it follows the movement of salts, based on a principle called osmosis.
So, in many cases, diarrhea is caused by intestine cells secreting salts (primarily sodium)
and water following passively along. Oral rehydration does not
diarrhea, but keeps the
body hydrated and healthy until the diarrhea passes. Recipe There are several commercially
available products but an inexpensive home-made solution consists of 8 level teaspoons of
sugar and 1 level teaspoon of table salt mixed in 1 liter of water A
half cup of orange juice
or half of a mashed banana can be added to each liter both to add potassium and to improve
taste. If commercial solutions are used, true
rehydration solutions should be used and sports
drinks should be avoided (especially in younger children) as these solutions contain too
much sugar and not enough electrolytes

10.2.3 Awareness Campaign on Fever
Fever is a state of the body in which its temperature rises above the normal body
temperature due to injury, infectious inflamation and swelling or due to some unknown
internal or external reasons.
The normal temperature of human body is 90'F; when it goes upto 100'F or
more, it is called fever In the other scale the temperature of a normal human body
ranges from 35.8'C to 37.5'C. If it crosses 37.5'C, it is said that the person has an
attack of fever
Generally the rise in temperature may be feit by touching the forehead or skin but
to know the temperature correctly a thermometer is used. Usually the thermometer is
in the arm-pit or under the tongue and it is kept in the arm-pit or under the tongue
for
to 2 minutes. The temperature under the tongue is generally 19F higher than that
in the arm-pit. Before
the thermometer for another person, it should be shaken
will and kept in anti-septic lotion for harfan hour:
Causes (of Normal) Fever
(1)
Germs or virus infections lead to Influenza, malaria, kalajwar, Typhoid, Pneumo-
nia, Meningilther, inflamation in the middle ear, abscess and Tuberculosis.
Bleading due to brain injury.
3)

Long-term fever may last for some
to some months for example
Typhoid, Tuberculogis, cancer, etc
Types of fever
(1)  Ifbody temperature is 10O9F or more, it is called fever or Pysexia.
When body temperature is over 1059F, it is called hyper pysexia
Fever caused by cough and cold, bleeding in the brain, malaria, kalajwar,
Typhoid, Meningitis, etc. fall in this group
(3)
Continued Fever Usually high temperature is continuous from the outset With-

10.2.7 Awareness Campaign On Thalassaemia
In 1925, Dr Thomas B
Cooley gave the first description of severe Thalassaemia. He described
series of cases with anaemia, enlarge
and liver in children. The disease was widely prevalent in
countries adjoining the Mediterranean sea, named as Thalassaemia.
The word
Thalassaemia' is
originated from Greek word;
Thales
means sea and
'Haima' meaning blood
It was thought that to
prevent malaria infection, red blood cell changes its hemoglobin gene. In that way Thalassaemic changes
occurred in globin
In
Cyprus a grave
was found which
was made in the year 7000 BC
Thalassaemia gene was detected in human particle obtain from it. The Thalassaemia is a congenital,
hereditary recessive disorder caused by mutation of globin gene affecting the globin chain of hemoglobin
molecule. There are
types of globin chain in hemoglobin. One hemoglobin molecule contains two
alpha peptide chain and two Beta peptide chain attached with one hemo molecule. Gene for alpha
globin chain is present in the chromosome 16, whereas gene for beta-globin is situated on chromosome
11. Thalassaemia is an inherited disorder which is caused due to the mutation of cither alpha or beta
gene clusters. Each year about 400,000 infants are born with serious hemoglobinopathies and carrier
frequency is about 270 million
Approximately 3-4% population of India are Thalassaemia carrier In
West Bengal approximately 10% population are Thalassaemia carrier In India it is more prevalent in
communities like Sindhis, Punjabis, Gujaratis, Marwaris, Bengalis  Both parents are thalassaemia carrier
then there is a 25% chance of a thalassaemic child to be born A thalassaemic child carry two defective
globin gene
Thalassaemia disease can not be transmitted by
mosquito bite. It is not a contagious
disease, can not be sexually transmitted:
Thalassaemia carrier :
thalassaemia carrier carries one defected gene
carry this gene from one generation to
generation.
Both sexes are equally affected:
Thalassaemia is mainly two type- Alpha Thalassaemia and Beta Thalassaemia
Symptoms of Thalassaemia
Irritability, unwillingness to feed, recurrent infection like cough, cold
Anaemia and weekness
Facial bone deformity
Thalassaemic Facies
Enlarged liver and spleen
Liver disease
endocrine gland dysfunction, cardiac problem due to iron deposition
Delayed pubertal changes
TIreatment
Blood transfusion and monitoring- Generally one patient requires blood transfusion at 3 4 weeks
interval when hemoglobin drops down below 7 gm%. Packed Red blood cell may be transfused for
two to three consecutive
it depends on hemoglobin level and symptoms of patient.
regular Folic Acid and Calcium supplement  VitC and iron tonic should not be given.
Iron chelation
Generally after 10-20 units blood transfusion
iron chelation required . There ore
three types of chelator
Deferipron, Deferasirox and Desferoxamine.
Hormone Therapy- Thalassaemia patient required hormone supplement to maintain proper
and pubertal development.
Splenectomy- When it is hugely enlarged , splenectomy required.

Bone marrow transplant and gene therapy- Thalassaemia is a life long condition
It can be cured
only by bone marrow transplant and gene therapy or Stem Cell Therapy These methods are very
expensive and not readily available or are in the experimental stage ; patients survive only on supportive
management The average cost of treatment involving transfusions, chelation & other therapies is more
than Rs.l,0o,00O/-peryear _
Thalassaemia patient should not eat any iron containing food.
Thalassaemia Impact on Children
Due to the nature of the disease a thalassaemic child miss classes and a large proportion may
out eventually
A Child with Thalassaemia may have problems with growth & development and comparison with
peers may cause mental distress
A Child with Thalassaemia
may have a permanent intravenous injection (portacath, vascuport)site
under the skin & should not participate in contact sports or swimming
Teacher's insufficient
knowledge on the nature of the disease & its impact on the child pose
barriers to the integration of the chronically ill child into the classroom situation.
Carriers and their impact on society:
Thalassaemia carriers are healthy and
can not be differentiated from
a normal person
Thalassaemia carrier can donate blood.
So an apparently normal person may be a Thalassaemia carrier A carrier marries another carrier
unknowingly
Carriers form the potential channel of propagation of Thalassaemia to the next generation
Marriage between two carriers raises the risk of birth of a thalassaemic child.
Extensive Pre marital & early pre natal screening of suspect carrier couple could prevent such
births.
Regular counseling of carriers
their parents is an essential component of the campaign against
the
propagation of Thalassaemia
Thalassaemia prevention
To prevent birth of thalassaemia child the only way is to avoid marriage between two
thalassaemia carrier
If both parents are thalasasemia carrier, within 8-12 weeks of pregnancy Pre natal diagnosis is to be
done to prevent birth of a Thalassaemia child.
Role of youth in restricting the disease:-
Awareness
youth is the driving force behind the campaign for elimination of thalassaemia
Conscientious young persons will proactively take part in screening programme and imbue others
to follow suit.
Conversant young persons are reliable vehicle for spreading the message and for generating enough
peer pressure to
about the much needed change in the prevailing mind set
It is expected that those young persons identified as carriers Realizing the gravity of the situation
will
choose their partners judiciously

finer qualities in them, leadership qualities through social, patriotic, sports and cultural
activities should be nurtured According to modern educational philosophy, the subjects
that were treated as extra-curricular activities have now become an integral part of the
curriculum
School is the first and foremost institution that develops and recognises   the hid-
den talents of the students regarding sports, creative skills and other activities (Krityalies).
The students take active part in different programmes of the school thereby develop-
social, patriotic, sports and cultural qualities as wellas the leadership qualities. The
parents expect their sons and daughters to become a social beings through education
The school helps the students adjust themselves to different atmospheres At the same
time it helps them become self conscious and humane while intermingling with differ-

is a
spontaneous outcome
of the mental, physical and cognitive development of a child.
Considering the fact that children have spontaneous interest towards games and
sports, play based learning at school has been given importance to. Play-based learning
creates interest in the children towards the lessons. Now-a-days a new method of im-
parting education has been devised combining work, play and life together
It has
created a new
atmosphere in school. At the school level work, play and life will be
integrated into an indivisible bond. The three elements will be present in a single subject
and the same feature will be reflected in the three elements. Such an atmosphere is to be
created in school where work will be game and game will be work. In other words, the
difference that exists between game and work is to be eliminated. The school atmo-
sphere will induce in the learners a spontaneous interest in works as
feel towards
games. In that case, an integrated bond of work, games and life may be created:
Children's right to play is an important part of the Law of children right. Due importance
has been given to children's right to play in the educational philosophy of the state and
steps have been taken to implement them Games and sports or Physical Education is
no more a co-curricular
activity; it is an equally important curricular subject Steps have
been taken to frame a sports policy in the state
The modern research has pointed out
that to come out of motionlessness lethargy a human
being has to do physical activities
